            <p>Muse is an ancient Greek mythology, a force personified as a woman who is a source of inspiration for a creative artist. So why the name Muse Lab? We came up with name muse referring to the mythical force of inspiration because we are believers of humans inspiring other humans to become better and grow. </p>
            <p>Muselab is a community of aspiring technologists, who co-learn, share technological ideas and network. We aim at creating an environment where technology is used to bring positive change in the world, consequently mentor and inspire future technologists.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
            	...If you know that you are different, that you are special in your thinking, that you will not stop until you cause disruption in the universal concept if creativity...that you are in yourself incomplete until you mould your own creation and are crazy enough to believe that your work will change the world...
            </p>
            <p>
            	Given the dynamic nature of the global socio economic status, the youth are increasingly pressured to learn and discover new ways to respond to the resulting challenges and opportunities. The strategies, techniques and resources to do so however aren't diversified enough to fully allow for their engagement.

            <p id="post1">
            <p><blockquote>"All great things are built in teams. " Ruchi Sanghvi - facebook first female engineer</blockquote>The team began as an idea from Britone Mwasaru with the objective of starting a culture of self-learning at the same time co-learning. </p>
            <p>Self-learning in the aspect that we are learning on our own without a supervisor (a lecturer as is in classes), this culture is important especially in the case for innovation and creativity. Its the self drive to learn and strive to be better. We read of stories of technology leaders who have changed the world with a formal education, a fact is most dropped out of the school.</p>
            <p>Co-learning is where we learn together, correct each other and inspire each other to learn more. Peer-to-peer learning fosters team work. Great technology was not created bt one individual who spent hours alone to build rather we hear of co-founders who helped create stuff.</p>
            <p>We taste our ideas, stimulate each other thats what makes great technology successful. Magic happens when we are all on the same page.</p>

            <h3><time>2<sup>nd</sup> April 2013</time>...Power of a Click</h3>
            <p>We may realise it or not but the mouse click is very powerful in technology. We the click we have access to the internet services such as social networking, mailing and even the normal desktop. </p>
            <p>Britone Mwasaru, a Muse Lab member has noticed the power of mouse click and is an evangelist for proper use of click and has made it his mission to ensure that in every technology he develops, he will ensure that the click brings change. This is a plus to his belief that technology is more about pushing the human race forward by helping humanity's work easier and efficient.</p>
            <p>We all at Muse Lab believe in the power of technology and encourage creation of technology tools not only for personal financial gain but for community gain.</p>
